i need to make the system which proves in any scenarios it can predict and perform well with any edge-cutting cases and say it is working fine 


extracting exons and introns from perticular dna or mrna 



why we are doing that : 
--Coded and Uncoded Regions: In a DNA or mRNA sequence, exons are the regions that code for proteins, while introns are non-coding regions. Identifying these regions helps us understand how genes are expressed.

--Pattern Identification: By analyzing patterns in DNA sequences, we can identify which regions are exons and which are introns. This is crucial for understanding gene functions and can be particularly useful when a new species is discovered.

--Applications: Knowing the structure of exons and introns can aid in classifying new organisms, understanding their genetic makeup, and possibly identifying them as new species.

In summary, a particular part of a gene is termed as a "coded region" (exon) if it contributes to the final protein product through translation. Conversely, it is termed as a "non-coded region" (intron) if it is not included in the final mRNA used for protein synthesis.

how we can achieve that : 

--To extract exons and introns, use a Python program that takes a DNA sequence and the positions of exons as input. The program then identifies and separates the exons and introns based on these positions.

what is splicing :
--Splicing: Splicing is the process by which introns are removed from a pre-mRNA transcript, and exons are joined together to form the final mRNA that will be translated into a protein. This process is crucial for producing functional proteins in eukaryotic cells.


-given  
  --exons sites 
  --introns sites with seq number 



note - we will implement how to extract exons and introns with seq.

the python program to extract the seq.. (this program needs modifications) -------------------------------------

---def find_introns_and_exons(dna_seq, exon_positions):
    """
    Identifies introns and exons in a given DNA sequence.

    Parameters:
    dna_seq (str): The DNA sequence.
    exon_positions (list of tuples): List of tuples where each tuple contains start and end positions of exons.

    Returns:
    dict: A dictionary with 'exons' and 'introns' keys containing respective sequences.
    """

    exons = []
    introns = []

    # Sort exon positions by start index
    exon_positions.sort()

    # Extract exons and introns
    prev_end = 0
    for start, end in exon_positions:
        if start > prev_end + 1:
            introns.append(dna_seq[prev_end:start])
        exons.append(dna_seq[start:end])
        prev_end = end

    if prev_end < len(dna_seq):
        introns.append(dna_seq[prev_end:])

    return {"exons": exons, "introns": introns}

# Example DNA sequence
dna_seq = "ATGCGTAACTGATGCGTACGTAGCTAGCGTATCGATCGTAGCTAGCGTAA"

# Example exon positions (1-based indexing)
exon_positions = [(0, 10), (20, 30), (40, 50)]  # Example positions

# Convert 1-based to 0-based for Python indexing
# exon_positions = [(start - 1, end) for start, end in exon_positions]

# Find introns and exons
result = find_introns_and_exons(dna_seq, exon_positions)

# Display results
print("Exons:")
for exon in result["exons"]:
    print(exon)

print("\nIntrons:")
for intron in result["introns"]:
    print(intron)

===========================================================================================================

now the main questions comes , how will i identify the seq from given series and say its exon and introns 
NOTE - precise identifications is required : -identification and the verification
Identifications:--

which seq can say its exons and introns :--

1)  BLAST tool :  it is heavely depended on Historical data , uses machine learning algos and determines which is exons and introns 

Questions 1) what if new spices arrives ?

we will use 3 methods to ientify perticular exons and intons :
1) 5prime and 3 prime splice :  GT as start of intons || AG as end of introns -> can be done by regular experessions 
2) CPG islands : CG appears frequently - higher exons 
3) patterns in necleoutides are more common in exons than introns
